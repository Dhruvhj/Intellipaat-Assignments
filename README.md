🎓 Intellipaat Data Engineering & DevOps Certification

📋 Certification Overview

This repository archives the complete practical coursework for the Intellipaat Data Engineering & DevOps Certification.

It demonstrates the end-to-end implementation of a modern data platform, bridging the gap between infrastructure (DevOps) and analytics (Data Engineering).

Core Objective: To master the lifecycle of data—from provisioning secure cloud infrastructure on Azure to automating deployments with Jenkins and processing big data with PySpark.

🧠 Skills & Competencies Acquired

☁️ 1. Cloud & Infrastructure (Microsoft Azure)

Resource Provisioning: Deployed Virtual Machines (VMs), Blob Storage, and SQL Databases.

Network Security: Configured VNET Peering, Subnets, and Network Security Groups (NSGs) to isolate environments.

Scaling Strategies: Implemented Vertical and Horizontal scaling for high-availability applications.

🐳 2. DevOps & Containerization

Docker: Wrote Dockerfiles to containerize Python ETL scripts, ensuring environment consistency across Dev/Test/Prod.

Kubernetes (K8s): Created YAML manifests for Deployments, Services (ClusterIP/NodePort), and ReplicaSets to orchestrate microservices.

CI/CD (Jenkins): Built declarative pipelines to automate testing and deployment triggers from GitHub.

📊 3. Data Engineering & Analytics

Advanced SQL: Optimized queries using CTEs, Window Functions, and Stored Procedures for complex data modeling.

Python/PySpark: Developed ETL scripts using Pandas/NumPy to clean and transform raw datasets.

Visualization: Designed interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize business KPIs.
