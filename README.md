Intellipaat Data Engineering & DevOps Certification

🎓 Certification Overview

This repository contains the complete collection of practical assignments, lab exercises, and code submitted for the Intellipaat Data Engineering & DevOps Certification.

The coursework focused on bridging the gap between software development, IT operations, and data engineering. It covered the full lifecycle of data—from infrastructure provisioning on Azure to building automated CI/CD pipelines and processing data with SQL and Python.

🧠 What I Learned

1. Cloud & Infrastructure (Microsoft Azure)

Resource Management: Learned how to provision and manage Azure resources like Virtual Machines (VMs), Blob Storage, and SQL Databases.

Networking: Gained hands-on experience setting up Virtual Networks (VNETs), Subnets, and Network Security Groups (NSGs) to secure cloud environments.

Scaling: Understood how to implement Vertical and Horizontal scaling to handle variable workloads.

2. DevOps & Containerization

Docker: Learned to "containerize" applications by writing Dockerfiles to package Python code and its dependencies, ensuring it runs the same way on my laptop as it does in production.

Kubernetes (K8s): Mastered the orchestration of containers. Learned to write YAML manifests to deploy applications, manage Pods, and expose services to the internet.

CI/CD (Jenkins): Built automated pipelines that detect code changes in GitHub and automatically trigger builds and tests, reducing manual deployment errors.

3. Data Engineering Fundamentals

Advanced SQL: Went beyond basic SELECT statements to master Complex Joins, Sub-queries, Stored Procedures, and Window Functions for data analysis.

Python for Data: Used libraries like Pandas and NumPy to clean messy datasets, handle missing values, and transform data for reporting.

Visualization: Connected data sources to Power BI to create interactive dashboards and reports for business intelligence.
